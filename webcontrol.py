#  to full, which is represented as 255 in DMX.

# We can now start the web control panel built into PyDMXControl.
# This will output the web address in console, but should be http://0.0.0.0:8080
# This runs in the background and so we can continue to do other things still.

# The console debug mode can also be started if required,
#  this provides basic control options in the console of the program.
# This is blocking however and so the script will not continue past here until
#  the debug control is exited. This won't stop DMX output.
#dmx.debug_control()

# Once the console debug mode is exited the script will continue, to stop it
#  exiting and stopping DMX output when can use a built-in sleep function.
# This sleep function will wait until enter is pressed in the console before continuing.
dmx.sleep_till_enter()

# With everything done, you can terminate the DMX output and the program by calling
#  the close method of the controller.
# This will cleanly close any threads in use and stop DMX output.
